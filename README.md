# grape_helper_lib
Collection of functions built on grape to enhace its functionality. 

These functions were mainly built with edge prediction in mind.

## Dependencies

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Used to export data as dataframe
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Used for prediction models and metrics calculation
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - Used for vector/matrix operations
- [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) - Used for tutorials and to improve output in notebooks

## How to use
1. Download the `helper_lib` folder
1. Copy it to your python working directory
1. Install dependencies (optionally in a separate virtual environment)
